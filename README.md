# m7-js-lib v0.98 (Legacy)

⚠️ **Legacy / Backwards Compatibility Notice**

This package (`v0.98`) exists **only for backwards compatibility** with older projects.
It is **no longer being actively maintained**.

Some functionality was tied to the **original bootstrapper**, which has since been fully re-implemented as **[m7BootStrap](./vendor/m7Bootstrap/README.md)**.
If you’re starting new work, **use m7BootStrap instead** — it provides modern APIs, dependency resolution, lifecycle hooks, and long-term support.

---

## ✅ Status

* Fully **battle-tested and production capable** — this library has been deployed in production for over **20 years**.
* However, some APIs are now redundant when combined with `m7BootStrap`. In most cases, it will serve little to no purpose outside of legacy environments.

---

## 📦 Usage

You can still use this as a load package with `m7BootStrap`:

```js
await bootstrap.load(
  "/vendor/m7-js-lib-098/src/package.json",
  { hooks: true }
);
```

Or simply import it as a module:

```js
import lib from "/vendor/m7-js-lib-098/src/lib098.js";
```

---

## 🔗 Migration

For modern projects, migrate to:

* **[m7BootStrap →](./vendor/m7Bootstrap/README.md)** – runtime package management & loader
* **[m7Fetch →](./vendor/m7Fetch/README.md)** – network and asset fetching system
